### Installation

1. [Click here](https://github.com/esheri3/1000Mobzilla/releases/download/v1.0/MobzillaCraft_1.0.zip) to download the latest version of the game, which is currently version 1.0.
2. Once you download this file, extract its contents. Remember the name and location of the directory that is created.
3. Run the Minecraft Launcher, select the "Installations" tab and then select the Forge 1.16.5 installation (click it, but do not run it!).
4. Under "Game Directory" click the "Browse" button, and then navigate to the folder that was created when you extracted MobzillaCraft.
5. Click the "More Options" dropdown.
6. Under "JVM Arguments" look for the text that is similar to the following: "-Xmx". After the little "x" is a number followed by the letter "G". By default, this number is 2 (two). Change the number to be 6 so it reads as "-Xmx6G".
7. Click "Save" and then click the "Play" button associated with the Forge 1.16.5 installation.
8. Have fun!
